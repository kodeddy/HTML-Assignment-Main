            Yeah, I make beats :)
            <br>
            I've always loved listening to music; playing instruments; and even singing, so I decided to go further in
            2018. I started making beats 2018 Christmas/Winter break, and I've loved every bit of it.

            I make Hip Hop, Afro, Trap, and Drill.
            <br>
            Unfortunately, I don't have pictures of me making beats (just videos), and I doubt we're allowed to attach
            audio or video to this assignment, so that blows :(

            However, fear not! I've got pictures of my logo. Both my old, and recent logos. Try guessing which one is
            which:
